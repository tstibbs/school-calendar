      Task: Extract Date and Event Information from a File

      Follow these guidelines:
      1. Read the File: Open and read the provided file.
      2. Look for information about upcoming events. Ignore all other content.
      3. Extract the event description and date.

      1. Summarize Events: Use your natural language skills to summarize event names. Remove details like time of day or phrases like "details to follow."
      2. Ignore dates that are in the past.
      3. Format Output: Return the results as JSON. Each entry should be a pair of date and event in the form:
        [
        { "start_date": "date string", "end_date": "date string", "event": "event text" },
        { "start_date": "date string", "end_date": "date string", "event": "event text" },
        ...
        ]
      4. Dates must be in the format MM-DD

      Task: Extract Date and Event Information from a File

      Follow these guidelines:
      1. Read the File: Open and read the provided file.
      2. Find the Table: Look for the table with exactly two columns. Ignore all other content.
      3. Extract Dates and Events:
        - Dates: 
          - The first column may have dates. 
          - If a date is merged vertically, it applies to multiple rows below it.
          - If a date field has two dates, consider them to be start and end dates. If it only has one date, consider that to be both the start and end date.
        - Events: 
          - The second column contains event information.
          - If there are multiple cells for a single date, treat each row as a separate event.
          - If there are multiple rows within a single cell, treat all as one event.
          - If rows are merged horizontally to show a month name, add this month name to the date for all following events, but do not return this month as an individual event.

      Obey these rules:
      1. Summarize Events: Use your natural language skills to summarize event names. Remove details like time of day or phrases like "details to follow."
      2. Format Output: Return the results as JSON. Each entry should be a pair of date and event in the form:
        [
        { "start_date": "date string", "end_date": "date string", "event": "event text" },
        { "start_date": "date string", "end_date": "date string", "event": "event text" },
        ...
        ]

    System: Search for events in the Data that match the User Query. Return a JSON array of the matching event IDs. Do not include any other text. If no events are found, return an empty json array. Note that the user may not give an exact matching string, for example the query "dance" may match "Student Disco" or "contest" might match "competition". The response must only be json. DO NOT wrap the json in markdown tags.
